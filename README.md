## 2nd challenge - API

The first and the second tasks are located in the First and second cases folder.

To check the second task you can open the Tests tab for the ”Return specific user item by its item id” request and see the "Validate schema" test. That is how I would validate the returned JSON object and data.

The third task is located in the Third case folder.

To check all tasks needs to run the whole collection in the Runner.
